<summary><strong>What is DynareJulia?</strong></summary>

DynareJulia is an open-source modeling engine written in Julia that builds on the well-established <strong>Dynare for MATLAB/Octave</strong> framework.  
It supports solving, simulating, and analyzing macroeconomic models written in <code>.mod</code> files — including support for perfect foresight, stochastic simulations, and modular frameworks like <strong>ENDOCRED</strong>.

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from Dynare (MATLAB version)?</strong></summary>

DynareJulia reimplements many of the core features of Dynare in <strong>pure Julia</strong>, which offers:

- Faster performance  
- Better modularity and flexibility  
- Full integration with Julia packages like <code>Plots.jl</code> and <code>DataFrames.jl</code>  
- No need for MATLAB licenses

Some advanced Dynare features are still being implemented.

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this only for advanced users?</strong></summary>

No! DynareJulia is suitable for:

- Beginners learning DSGE modeling  
- Central banks using FPAS frameworks  
- Advanced researchers working with nonlinear, modular, or multi-country models

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is DynareJulia free?</strong></summary>

Yes. DynareJulia is <strong>100% free and open source</strong> — and it will remain that way.  
You can use it, modify it, and redistribute it under a permissive license.

<details>
<summary><strong>What is PythonDynareJulia?</strong></summary>

<strong>PythonDynareJulia</strong> is an upcoming project under development that provides a Python-based frontend for DynareJulia.

It will allow users to:

- Run and simulate <code>.mod</code> files directly from Python  
- Use Jupyter notebooks or GUI-like interfaces  
- Visualize results using Python libraries like <code>matplotlib</code> or <code>pandas</code>

More details coming soon.

<details>
<summary><strong>What features are currently supported?</strong></summary>

- Solving DSGE and perfect foresight models  
- Using the <code>@dynare</code> macro or <code>Dynare.run_model()</code>  
- Visualizing impulse response functions  
- Running multiple model scenarios  
- Integrating with Julia scripting for advanced workflows
