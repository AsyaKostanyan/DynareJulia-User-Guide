## What is DynareJulia?

**DynareJulia** is a high-performance, modern, and flexible framework for solving, simulating, and analyzing dynamic economic models — written in **Julia**, and inspired by the powerful features of Dynare and the computational speed of Julia.

It is especially useful for researchers, economists, and policy analysts who need to:

- Solve DSGE, OLG, and other structural models
- Run simulations and perform sensitivity analysis
- Customize model components using Julia's extensive scientific ecosystem
